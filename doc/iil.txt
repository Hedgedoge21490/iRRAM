iRRAM (Interface|Intermediate) Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Computable function (proglet):
* GLSL-style:
** defines set of inputs and outputs
** defines one function 'compute' using these I/Os

Proglet with iRRAM functionality:
* provide iRRAM's data types
  (INTEGER/RATIONAL/DYADIC/REAL/COMPLEX/REALMATRIX/SPARSEREALMATRIX)
  and standard conversions from/to int/double/string
  + convenience structures (structs / (dyn) arrays / sets)

Requirements for compute:
* independence of names of Reals given as inputs, i.e. continuity
* re-runability, i.e. adhering to GCC's attributes
** leaf (?, c.f. limit)
** pure (when assuming inputs from their respective domains) or
   const (when additionally single_valuedness can be guarranteed 

Requirements for inputs/outputs:
* ability to provide, on request, data with any given accuracy,
  i.e. $Z\to\Sigma^*$

Create a data flow graph for all proglets and submit that to iRRAM.
